<h1>The Best Movies According to Maria</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Kimi No Na wa</h3>
<p>This is my favorite romantic fantasy anime film. A truly heartrending experience, but one that leaves you with a profound sense of relief!</p>

<h3>Just Go With It</h3>
<p>My go-to romcom film, especially when I'm feeling down. Best seen with a generous pint of your favorite ice cream.</p>

<h3>Tears of The Sun</h3>
<p>While the plot maybe simplistic, it's a solid action film that explores complex issues of morality, duty, and the human cost of war.</p>
